This is the README file for the Rivendell C API Package.


This is the C Library to use to interface with the Rivendell Database.  

The library utilizes the Rivendell WEB Interface API to complete all of it's tasks.  It 
generates a Web page that is passed to the Rivendell WEB server which processes the request
and send the response back to the calling function.

The C functions in this library need the EXPAT XML libary and the LIBCURL library installed
before they will work correctly.  Information on getting these libraries is below:

  The first library required is the EXPAT XMP Parser Library written in C which 
  is available on the internet at:
        http://sourceforge.new/projects/expat.

  This second library also required is the LIBCURL Library which is a free 
  open source client that can be used to get documents to and from servers using 
  many different protocols. It can be found at:
        http://curl.haxx.se/

The lib directory has all of the source code for the library.

The tests directory has an example of each of the C Library function calls.
By default - these function calls use hostname = "localhost", user = "USER",
and password = "" (null).  Three environment variables can be used to change
the default settings for HostName, Username and Password.  They are:
   RIVHOST     (Host Name to Connect To).
   RIVUSER     (Rivendell User Name to use).
   RIVPASS     (Rivendell User Password).


The docbook directory has documentation on using this library - both in HTML, PDF and 
MAN formats.
